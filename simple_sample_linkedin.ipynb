            "Rising global biofuel demand necessitates innovative production technologies. This article explores the challenges of waste-based biodiesel production and how Novonesis' FlexFit® technology supports sustainable, low-cost waste-based biodiesel processing. Global biofuel demand is on the rise, particularly in Europe, driven by the EU Renewable Energy Directive II and its objective to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. The transport sector accounts for a quarter of the total EU greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from road transport, followed by the marine, heating and non-road transport sectors. Meeting REDII requirements and ultimately achieving carbon neutrality across the EU calls for innovation of biofuel production technology. As the urgency to address climate change increases, there is a heightened focus on sustainable, low-carbon biofuels. While biodiesel is the most consumed renewable energy fuel, restrictions on crop-based biofuels necessitate a shift towards waste- and residue-based sources to meet ambitious climate targets. Accelerating the transition to low-carbon renewables presents a promising path toward emissions reduction and a more sustainable future. Adopting innovative approaches to bioprocessing to overcome myriad challenges will support the decarbonization of road transport in the EU. Learn more about Novonesis FlexFit\n",
            "Overcoming biodiesel processing challenges Differing national approaches and delayed policy updates within the EU can impede the transition to biodiesel use. Biodiesel processing solutions providers must work to make it easy for producers to integrate sustainable feedstocks into their production lines. Waste and residue-based feedstocks offer greener alternatives to conventional sources, but several significant challenges persist: Feedstock cost, supply and diversification Producers have increasingly diversified their feedstocks due to fluctuations in price and availability. However, this approach comes with processing challenges due to the variable quality of the feedstocks, particularly with free fatty acid (FFA) content. Energy-intensive processes pose economic challenges Converting FFA from diverse feedstocks into biodiesel via acid esterification is expensive due to high energy consumption, yield losses, and maintenance costs due to the corrosive nature of the process. Safety and environmental challenges Chemical catalysts pose fire and corrosion hazards. Proper handling is essential to minimize the environmental impact of these substances and the generated by-products. Addressing these challenges requires technological advancements, innovative solutions, and cross-sector collaboration to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of biodiesel production processes.\n",
            "How enzymatic biodiesel processing unlocks competitive advantage Despite these hurdles, biodiesel producers are optimistic. Strategies and viable technologies are crucial for ensuring profitability by improving efficiency and maximizing yield. These efforts mitigate risk, reduce capital investment and enhance product environmental footprint, thereby increasing the value of biodiesel. “A paradigm shift toward sustainable biofuels is underway with the focus on the transport sector, one of the toughest to decarbonize,” says Robert Lindström, global marketing manager for biodiesel at Novonesis. “However, no single technology can solve the myriad issues in this sector or non-transport sectors.” Lindström emphasizes the importance of feedstock flexibility and the adaptability of biodiesel production in meeting REDII mandates. He anticipates a division among European biodiesel producers. Some will persist with traditional feedstocks, while others will opt for greater flexibility, adjusting their processing lines to accommodate a broader range of sustainable feedstocks. This adaptive approach promises to give the latter a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving business landscape. Enzymatic biodiesel processing offers a pathway for biodiesel producers aiming to process sustainable feedstock blends into high-quality biodiesel while cutting overall production costs. Novonesis FlexFit® technology helps producers enhance revenues, cut capital and operating expenses, and extend equipment service life: Flexibility for processing a broad range of feedstocks , including those with glycerides and high FFAs, can boost biodiesel yield by up to 3% and increase revenues compared to acidcatalyzed esterification or glycerolysis treatment. Capital outlay is minimal as enzymatic biodiesel processing operates at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. Operating costs are low . Pretreatment involves a simple water/acid wash and pH adjustment for low-quality feedstocks. Processing temperatures stay below 40°C, and methanol rectification costs are minimal. Reduced maintenance and equipment wear due to the limited use of corrosive chemicals, provide further savings in time and costs.\n",
            "A tailored sustainable solution for waste-based biofuel production Novonesis supports evidence-based initiatives aimed at mitigating climate change that promote the use of waste oils and advanced biofuels. To that end, we have joined the European Waste-based & Advanced Biofuels Association (EWABA). Together, they are undertaking comprehensive evaluations of technologies and energy sources and conducting life cycle assessments. The objective? To identify and develop the most cost-effective and sustainable ways to produce biodiesel fuels today and tomorrow. Unlocking increased feedstock flexibility is critical for FAME producers. However, 47% of producers see a shift to waste feedstocks as the biggest challenge over the next 10 years, according to a 2022 survey.* To help producers overcome the challenge, Novonesis offers FlexFit® technology. This gamechanging bioprocessing concept supports biodiesel projects from conception to commercial operation. It is an integrated solution, combining world-class process technology, innovative biotech, all-inclusive services, and a performance guarantee to help biodiesel producers easily handle varying feedstocks.   “Enzymatic biodiesel production allows producers to make their feedstock decisions based on availability and costs, rather than be constrained by processing ability.”  – Robert Lindström, Novonesis, Global Marketing Manager for biodiesel   Novonesis engineering experts help biodiesel producers identify opportunities to adapt existing facilities to manage feedstock flexibility in five straightforward phases:\n",
            "Today, more than 30 biodiesel plants worldwide are supported by Novonesis biosolutions for enhanced processing flexibility, better control over feedstock quality, and reduced production costs. With biosolutions, producers can meet REDII requirements by adopting waste-based feedstocks. At the same time, you can expect to produce high quality biodiesel, maximize profitability, and accelerate time to market.
